This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as mileage, year of manufacture, brand, and descriptive text. The dataset contains both numerical and textual data, requiring a combination of preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to build a robust model that can estimate car prices accurately, involving regression models evaluated by RSME score.
